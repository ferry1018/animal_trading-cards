		  <p>Tigers are powerful and majestic big cats known for their striking orange coat marked with dark stripes, providing effective camouflage in their natural habitats. They have a robust build, powerful limbs, and distinctive facial markings, including white spots on their ears. Tigers are solitary and territorial predators, known for their stealth and agility when hunting prey. With a keen sense of sight and hearing, they are top predators in their ecosystems, playing a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance. Unfortunately, many tiger subspecies are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching, emphasizing the importance of conservation efforts.</p>
